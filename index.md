## Project: Social-Technical Research on Phishing (STROP)

Phishing is used by offenders to obtain credentials from unsuspecting users. Fake websites, fake emails and even phone-calls are used as a modus operandi. With these credentials, money is stolen, or services are used and billed to the victim's account. Even though the share of malware attacks is rising, phishing attacks remain a commonly used method of fraud.

The aim of the project is to identify characteristics of victims of phishing attacks and characteristics of offenders, evaluate anti-phishing measures, and propose new methods of reducing the victimisation by offenders using the phishing modus operandi. Whereas currently most research uses either a technical approach (e.g. implement a new protocol) or a social approach (how likely are people to become a victim), this project intends to develop a combined socio-technical approach. This approach includes establishing a theoretical framework and putting phishing in the context of this framework.
